    Hey there 👋
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm Kyrylo Silin 🇺🇦, and I've had my fair share of ups and downs in the
    professional world. Getting laid off not once, but twice in the first half of
    2023 was a wakeup call 📞😰. It made me realize that I want to be the captain 👨‍✈️ of my
    own ship ⛴️
  </p>

  <p>
    For over a decade, I've been immersed in the world of Ruby programming. It's not
    just a skill for me, it's a passion that's been brewing 🍺 for years. I want to put
    out as many products as I can until something clicks and starts making waves 🌊
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not knee-deep in Ruby code, you'll find me exploring new corners of
    the world. My wife, a native of the Philippines 🇵🇭, has opened my eyes to the
    wonders of her homeland. I've even managed to pick up a bit of Tagalog and
    Cebuano along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
  I'd be thrilled if you joined me on this journey. Let's build something amazing ✨ together.
