Manila still remains the city of contrasts. Somebody lives in expensive condominiums.

Somebody survives in DIY houses.

Somebody captured the moon with a net of wires (me).

Personal protective equipment for construction workers.

Some parts of the equipment can be looted by anybody because it hangs on the walls.

Although living conditions are different, the roads are shared by everyone.

Some roads are shared with pedestrians (!). I wonder if they need an according licence for their shoes to use the roads.

The poshest Jollibee I've seen so far. It looks almost like a typical Apple Store to me.

This wall would probably be illegal somewhere in Germany.
