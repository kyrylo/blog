My first encounter with the concept wasn’t online. It came from
[Goosebumps](https://kids.scholastic.com/kid/books/goosebumps/) gamebooks.

As a teenager, I loved renting Goosebumps books from a local market. I’d race
home, eager to dive into their spooky stories. One day, I stumbled upon a
gamebook version. It was unlike anything I’d read before.

[Gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) aren’t linear. They let you
shape the story by making choices. I remember deciding whether to enter a creepy
basement or explore dark woods. Both sounded terrifying, but each choice led to
a new page and a new adventure.

When I first used the internet, hyperlinks immediately reminded me of those
books. Clicking a link to jump to a new page felt just like flipping to page 57
to escape a monster.

The genius of HTML and the web is easy to take for granted, but it’s
revolutionary. It’s simple and natural&mdash;just like those gamebooks.

Looking back, those gamebooks were my first taste of interactive storytelling.
Who knew they’d prepare me for a love of the internet and the way we connect
through it today?
