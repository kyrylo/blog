Playing Counter-Strike 1.6 opened up the world of programming for me.

Although you can’t code within the game, you can create your own config files.
These configs are sets of instructions that control different aspects of the
game.

For instance, you can tweak the gravity on your server to let players jump
higher.

On the client side, you can customize your crosshair’s appearance
programmatically.

Pretty cool, right? And see, I just used some technical terms like “config,”
“client,” “server,” and “execute.” They’re all part of programming, and I got a
grasp of them even before writing any code.

I also picked up on the concept of “ping” to check if a server was too laggy.

Understanding vertical synchronization helped me boost my FPS.

Plus, I had to input various commands on the game console to manage bots or
connect to a server with its IP address.

Customizing key binds was a game-changer, like binding jumping to the mouse
wheel for easier bunny hopping.

And speaking of bunny hopping, it was a bug in the game engine, which taught me
about bugs and engines.

Then there were file extensions; CS 1.6 maps had the <code>.bsp</code>
extension. And I learned about waypoints because the game could automatically
create them in a map editor.

Downloading and loading replays with a command, connecting with others through
IRC, DC++, and similar tools—these were all part of the experience.

Counter-Strike 1.6 wasn’t just a game; it was my life. It taught me basic system
administration, scripting, and console work—all while having fun.

I don’t know of any other game that can provide the same experience.
