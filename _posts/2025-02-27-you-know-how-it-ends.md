<pre>
Something great arrives —
sleek code, fast and light.
It grows with time, gathers features,
still brilliant, now seasoned, full.

Then a new version, more layers.
Fine, I don’t need it, but fine.
Another update — wait, what?
What’s this doing here?

Soon it’s sluggish, bloated,
and you begin to resent it.

Could it be different?
What should’ve stopped long ago
drags on, relentless.

When something great is born,
you know its end.
See the finish in its first spark.
