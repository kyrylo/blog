A month ago, I bought a cheap, used mountain bike. Iâ€™ve ridden it twice since
then (or technically three times, counting the test ride after I bought it). Why
did I go for a cheap bike? Well, I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d actually enjoy cycling. Turns
out I do.

By the way, this is my second bike. My first one met a tragic end when I took a
spill over the handlebars on a hill. That fateful crash was the end of my steel
companionâ€”dented wheels were the least of its problems. I tried fixing it
myself, but only made things worse. Back then, I didnâ€™t have the skillsâ€”or, more
importantly, the internet.

## Conquering the roads

With my second bike, I set myself a clear goal: I want to learn how to cycle on
roads, not sidewalks. For one, cycling on sidewalks isnâ€™t allowed by the rules.
And besides, itâ€™s _much_ faster to ride on roads.

## From noisy chains to game day

Thursday was a perfect day for cyclingâ€”10Â°C, clear skies, and a mild breeze. My
route was from home to the township of
[Vysoky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vysokyi). Why Vysoky? I wanted to catch a
football match between [Metalist](https://fcmetalist.com.ua/) and ETM. Vysoky is
where Metalistâ€™s training camp is located.

Two days before the game, Iâ€™d taken a ride around Kharkiv and noticed my bike
chain was making odd noises, so I needed to oil it. Iâ€™d never done that before,
so I turned to the internet for help. Half of Wednesday went to finding and
buying oil and oiling the chain. The rest of the day I spent trying to adjust
the transmission for better reliabilityâ€”also a first for me. I didnâ€™t finish it
that day, so I had to continue on Thursday morning. Luckily, the game didnâ€™t
start until 4 p.m., so I planned to leave around 2.

By Thursday, Iâ€™d managed to get the bike somewhat fixed. I double-checked the
chain and felt nearly ready to go, but... I realized the transmission was still
acting up. Bloody buggering hell! I gave it a third try, and finally, it worked.
The time was 3 p.m.â€”no problem; I could still catch the second half.

## The journey: cycling to Vysoky (almost)

I started cycling around 3:10. The distance to Vysoky was 25 km, so the round
trip would be 50 km.

Obviously, I decided to stick to the sidewalks, as neither I nor my bike was
road-ready. Why? First, I didnâ€™t know traffic rules well enough (I didnâ€™t even
have a driverâ€™s license). Second, I didnâ€™t have reflectors or lights. I did have
a helmet, but since Iâ€™d be using sidewalks anyway, I figured it was safe without
it. Iâ€™m not an aggressive cyclist, either.

As I rode, I noticed that cyclists tend to attract attention here. I had a few
random interactions along the way. But anyway, enough of these sentimental
details. What about football? Iâ€™ll be honestâ€”I didnâ€™t make it to Vysoky, and I
didnâ€™t see the match. I cycled about 22 km and then realized it was about to
rain. So, screw footballâ€”I decided not to get wet and dirty and turned back.
Unfortunately, it rained anyway. I got soaked, covered in mud, and coldâ€”all
while wearing shorts.

Thatâ€™s how far I got.

Cycling back was tough. I was exhausted. Iâ€™d already hit my second wind and was
working on my third. Suddenly, the transmission problem popped up again. Gear
shifts were clunky, making it really hard to ride uphill, so I had to dismount.
But since Iâ€™m writing this, I made it home alive.

## Lessons learned: roads, rain, and resilience

There are a lot of cyclists playing with fire on our roads. Riding in the dark
without lights is practically asking for trouble. I also realized how awful
sidewalks are for cycling here. The curbs are high, ramps are scarce, and the
sidewalk asphalt quality is terrible. Still, despite everything, I enjoyed this
little adventure.

Oh, and by the way, Metalist won: Metalist 6:0 ETM.
