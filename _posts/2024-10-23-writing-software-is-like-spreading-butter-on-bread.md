A slice of freshly baked bread is filled with thousands of pores. The problems
these pores represent can be covered with a thin layer of creamy butter - just
like your program. The smoother your butter, the more polished your software
seems.

But do you always spread butter perfectly evenly? Do you try to cover every
single pore? That would be ridiculous. Yet, if you don’t spread enough butter,
the bread won’t taste good or look appetizing.

Writing perfect code is pointless. You don’t need to cover every pore, but you
should make it appealing, like a good sandwich. A perfectly even layer of butter
might look great in photos, but in real life, nobody cares. Heck, most people
won’t even notice.

Now, imagine adding a thick layer of sweet jam on top. That jam represents the
entropy you face when users interact with your software.

You can’t predict exactly how the jam will spread. It follows the path of
least resistance, dictated by gravity. You can’t defy gravity. Don’t try to
control how the jam spreads - just let it do what it’s going to do.

Writing software is like spreading butter on bread. Don’t aim for perfect
sandwiches - just make them good enough to enjoy.
