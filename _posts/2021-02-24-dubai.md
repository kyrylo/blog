Prior to going to Dubai, I already had certain expectations. That said, I didnâ€™t
expect that my first experience would be falling for a scam. Well, kind of. You
see, as a Ukrainian citizen, I can visit the UAE without a visa. However, I was
dumb enough to pay some agency to provide me with a tourist visa. When I had
paid them the full amount, I realised that was a mistake. When I asked for a
refund (30 minutes after my payment), they refused.

Alas, thatâ€™s the price I had to pay for being careless. I was able to enter the
UAE with a visa that nobody even checked.

Let's start. Dubai is the land of cars.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m4xZp04.jpg" width="700">

When you are a pedestrian in this city, it's considered a mishap. When you are a
pedestrian, you wait. No, you WAIT.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6VHsGBh.jpg" width="700">

If you don't want to WAIT, you may go. Just don't expect this experience to be
safe or pleasant. Sometimes there are no sidewalks in Dubai.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YyXsuSj.jpg" width="700">

So, if you don't want to take a taxi, don't expect that it'll be free
either. Dubai forces you to pay. The more, the better. The fine for jaywalking
here is 400 dirhams (about $110).
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JGKzMkN.jpg" width="700" loading=lazy/>

Without a way to cross the road, without a safe sidewalk, a daily routine such
as going to the grocery store turns into a suicide mission that you'll have to
fund if the police catches you.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/bEpcvr2.jpg"/>

Although I am a daring individual, I would not go beneath an overpass for no
apparent reason. I found myself there looking for a method to go around this
juncture. There was no such thing, as it turned out. A kilometer away was the
nearest crossing (not just a safe crossing, but any crossing).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/hkcd6LO.jpg"/>

You have no chance against this concrete jungle, even if you wish to take a
gamble and run for your life while evading rapid cars.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/Jnq0RBD.jpg"/>

Some of the crossings are not that safe. Take a look at how broad this junction
is. You can easily erect another skyscraper here.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/1SuE5rM.jpg"/>

This particular crossing has a tiny pedestrian island. I wouldn't feel
comfortable there waiting for my green light.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/k3FEfT7.jpg"/>

Basically, everyone here screams that you're not welcome when you transport
yourself using something other than a wheel.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/t6XQyvq.jpg"/>

It's really surprising to me that walking in Dubai is tough. I can clearly see
that the city invests in public transportation. Walking and public
transportation go together (or walk together?). Dubai offers multiple ways of
budget traveling. One is renting a bicycle. I was eager to try it out, but I
couldn't because I didn't have mobile data when I was on the street. In order to
rent a bicycle, you need an app and an internet connection.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/3A46y90.jpg"/>

Cycling infrastructure does exist in Dubai, but it's not connected together. The
bicycle lanes here end abruptly, and you are forced to yield to cars.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/0KvRpcE.jpg"/>

As a result, not many choose to cycle.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/NEoU9be.jpg"/>

Those who do prefer cycling might even have no infrastructure whatsoever.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/FsZ0ZMZ.jpg"/>

If you don't yield to a car, you might bump into a road worker's middle finger
in the form of pavement construction.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/ecNdmxs.jpg"/>

In other cases, the cycling infrastructure is there, but the cyclists have not
yet been born in that area. And to be perfectly honest, some paint on the ground
is not cycling infrastructure.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/SC8zhaU.jpg"/>

Anyway, enough of the cycling. You can take a tram in Dubai.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/xXIUwwy.jpg"/>

The only problem is that the coverage is rather poor. The tracks start from
nowhere and lead to nowhere.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/dCIZZBS.jpg"/>

A much better alternative would be the Dubai Metro, a fast and completely
autonomous railway system covering all key destinations in the city.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/wW6qQu2.jpg"/>

Every station looks identical (unlike in my city, where every station must have a
personality).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/kczcz4B.jpg"/>

The metro is also completely safe. There's no way to fall on the tracks. What I
love about it is that everything is automated. What I don't love is that there
are separate coaches for women and men. Women can go inside coaches for men, but
men are not allowed to go to the women's place.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/pspN1do.jpg"/>

I also am not a fan of strict rules like no eating or drinking, or even chewing
gum.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/ESVgVM2.jpg"/>

No chewing gum yadda-yadda, very dangerous yadda-yadda, can cause a trainwreck
yadda.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/ifoHa6q.jpg"/>

Those four birds that are not following the leader clearly didn't obtain their
flying license legally. I don't think flying like that is okay in the UAE. Does
anyone know how many dirhams the fine is for that violation? And also, if they
chewed bubble gum, that amount would probably be doubled.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/PyfPlIX.jpg"/>

In general, most of Dubai's life finds itself on Sheikh Zayed Road. The cars and
the trains make this experience quite noisy. Even with your windows closed.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/TXpSrF5.jpg"/>

Speaking of penalties, the signs informing us what's not allowed are
everywhere. I actually think some of them make sense, like this "red light
violation" rule. However, given the technological advances Dubai has made, I
think it's a rather poor attempt. We can install such a sign here in Ukraine,
but it won't do any good. Dubai, with trillions of dollars, can develop a more
advanced solution. An automated system that imposes certain rules on everybody
would be perfect. The little human interaction, the better. Anyway, I'm not
gonna solve it for you, Dubai (unless you share with me some of your
petrodollars).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/X0DamYZ.jpg"/>

If you do speed, you have no chance against the police here. By using muscle
cars, they can chase anyone without breaking a drop of sweat.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/n2mNiZ1.jpg"/>

This is probably the only place in the world where bus stations have automatic
sliding doors and air conditioning.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/5IEwzOZ.jpg"/>

Having no internet on the go, I did appreciate the detailed map of bus routes.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/fee5hbW.jpg"/>

However, at a bus terminal, the stops were rather inconvenient & uninformative,
providing only a little bit of shadow.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/DDJF13q.jpg"/>

The buses themselves are fairly modern and convenient to use (and
air-conditioned as well).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/GlCHeaZ.jpg"/>

Wheelchair passengers are welcome to use them as well. I didn't spot any people
using wheelchairs in Dubai, though.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/B9wpuHN.jpg"/>

At some metro stations, I saw a hi from the past: a payphone. In order to use
this particular exhibit, you would need to bring some change and also wire up
your own telephone handset (inserting the ends of the wires directly into your
ears can be tried but is not recommended).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/ICCLlke.jpg"/>

While most of the things you see in these pictures are brand new, this lamp post
is not. I'm sure it's new as well, but it tries to look vintage, which makes it
look out of place.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/qiqO2E7.jpg"/>

Similarly to the Philippines, the rear side of trucks mentions a number to call
in case the driver goes bananas on the road.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/MQJ3bV0.jpg"/>

In turn, if you want to go bananas, there's a number for "Home & Hotel" service
available in town. The service can be Russian, Turkish, or Pakistani. Hmmmm...
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/vsDhUyi.jpg"/>

Basically, closer to the evening time, there's someone who sows the unfertile
soil of Dubai with these pamphlets. I was surprised to see something like that
in a place that is protected by Sharia law.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/3EZZ3OU.jpg"/>

Most of the time, the streets of Dubai look deserted. Wide highways and large
distances between buildings with no people walking make it hard to believe that
the city is home to 3.3 million inhabitants.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/7jwTr3V.jpg"/>

Everything changes at night, when the heat is lower. Dubai is about luxury, so
people spend their time spending.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/bPrAeAr.jpg"/>

If you are from a hot climate country, or maybe you've been to such a country,
you might take a guess and say that during the day there's nobody on the streets
because everybody is inside malls. Well, that's a witty observation. Let's take
a gander at one of the malls during lunchtime.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/kYpmChd.jpg"/>

Nope, nobody's here. Maybe they went to a park for a picnic?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/9tgkWVh.jpg"/>

I can see a few lost souls, but that's not a park for a city that has such a
high population. Maybe they are skiing?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/XgQrvpn.jpg"/>

It seems like it's almost nobody, again. Maybe the men are at work?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/rwDkrBv.jpg"/>

Nope... Yo, where's everyone in this city?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/eUcGucy.jpg"/>

Dubai's land skyline is dotted with skyscrapers. But who is this built for if
the streets are empty?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/nh7ifrn.jpg"/>

You turn your head to the left and see skyscrapers.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/sCZTtq5.jpg"/>

You turn your head to the right - the sea?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/lTmhhmU.jpg"/>

Most of the skyscrapers look blue.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/zSnDLCT.jpg"/>

Not all of the city is like that. These barracks are for Indians or
Pakistanis. They make up the majority of workers here in Dubai.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/zFrQ8pN.jpg"/>

This is apparently a church in the same area (or a mosque?).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/26BRn3l.jpg"/>

I was ignorant enough to read this as "TOILET". To be honest, in some of the
areas of this neighborhood, I could smell an unpleasant presence.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/i7wORe5.jpg"/>

Guys, I am not lying. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that this is also
the scariest place I found in Dubai. The city feels very safe in general.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/zt7iZIL.jpg"/>

Even in the worst neighborhoods of Dubai, school buses dare to go inside.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/7m65V9r.jpg"/>

Sometimes there's even fancy architecture.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/wI9qMGV.jpg"/>

Being a multinational city, occasionally you will see Russian signs in Dubai.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/a2xQEY2.jpg"/>

I was especially surprised to see this Russian ballet dance center on the
outskirts of the city (and, please, don't ask me what I was doing there. I was
just trying to find a way to cross a road, okay?).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/I08Wpfw.jpg"/>

You can also find some imported Russian products.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/phtV486.jpg"/>

I was especially surprised to find Ukrainian ice cream here (which is the best
ice cream in the world, by the way).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/K1B5Dfo.jpg"/>

Speaking of other products, there were a lot of Filipino goods available
at supermarkets.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/UvozFQ3.jpg"/>

That's not an accident. According to my personal perception, 1/3 of the country
speaks Filipino. No matter where you go, Filipinos will be working there. It was
fun to practice my Tagalog once again and surprise a few folks. "Kabayan" in
Tagalog means "fellow citizen".
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/ZLbKGpF.jpg"/>

There's a Catholic church available to everyone. But I guess it exists mostly
because of the Filipino community here.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/uF522PA.jpg"/>

What I don't get is why it looks like Alcatraz. Look at the gate and the barbed
wire.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/uNDUSgT.jpg"/>

Usually, the Catholic churches I've been to look very nice both inside and
outside. This one has a 3-meter concrete wall, which can withstand a direct hit
from a modern tank, and 3-meter screens to catch all incoming grenades. Do they
do masses there or mass shootings? What are they hiding there? Or is it to
protect them from the outside? There are too many questions for a church.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/9USQiy9.jpg"/>

Filipinos do love their pork. I think that's why in certain supermarkets there
is a pork section. The sign says "for non-Muslims," but it should really say
"for Filipinos."
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/8D1FoKs.jpg"/>

Dubai keeps erecting new condominiums. The construction is sprawling.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/5OoWrNy.jpg"/>

Surprisingly, at the same time, the city feels empty.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/A7pBkrJ.jpg"/>

Tolerance bridge won't save the situation if there's nobody who can tolerate or
be tolerated.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/poAhdFw.jpg"/>

Don't forget that the climate here is pretty harsh. I was lucky enough to visit
Dubai in February. People told me that the coldest season is now. All the
bushes, all the grass, it wasn't growing by itself.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/sZcp6kv.jpg"/>

It's all man-made. Without a man's touch, nature will eventually restore
everything back to how it was.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/Xsn4T0D.jpg"/>

A lot of money is wasted on these green pastures. What's the point? Nobody walks
here, people who drive don't care that much.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/LG731Ad.jpg"/>

Moreover, to keep it green, you have to waste the most precious resource on
our planet, water.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/RsByUZF.jpg"/>

I also don't see any cows around. Who knows, they might convert that into a cow
field and produce some Dubalpine milk.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/sH3kg4C.jpg"/>

Dubai isn't a new city but it still lacks history. They tried to build
"historical" places, but they look too modern.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/Qh5v85A.jpg"/>

But I will admit that some of it does look very beautiful.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/AtrJBkn.jpg"/>

I love the idea of donating old or unused clothes. We don't have such boxes in
Ukraine, so I just donate some of my clothes to people I know. If we had these
boxes, I would do that much more frequently.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/tlM2hX5.jpg"/>

I heard the Dubai Mall is the biggest in the world. I don't know if that still
remains true, but I do know that it's a clever idea to denote what language
every staff member can speak.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/tyxHRim.jpg"/>

Being the biggest mall in the world doesn't guarantee the largest number of
visitors. It was relatively empty.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/n5og6BB.jpg"/>

I don't blame people. In order to get here, you need to ride the metro. When
you're at the station, it's a 15-minute walk through an overpass tunnel going
straight to the mall. Yes, there are conveyor belts to speed this up, but even
with them, it's a very uncomfortable experience because there's not much to look
at.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/Yqm8vTF.jpg"/>

I think people would happily use golf carts or electric scooters in order to get
to the mall or back to the metro station. That's a free business idea for you,
Dubai.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/NfjwFaV.jpg"/>

I have a tradition: I go to McDonald's in every country that I visit and order a
Big Mac.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/dvdpDrc.jpg"/>

What's cool in the UAE is that I can customize my Big Mac and literally beef it
up.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/v7DOAVC.jpg"/>

I didn't see any squirrels here. Who should live in that house?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/c7C0mkz.jpg"/>

This guy?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/g1mhTyM.jpg"/>

A lot of famous tech companies are located in Dubai Internet City.
Oracle.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/faHyp1d.jpg"/>

Microsoft.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/mGop3Ge.jpg"/>

Most of the fancy buildings are built by Emaar. Their brand name is everywhere.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/43PQGxL.jpg"/>

Emaaaaaaar! Find it in this picture.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/kRaEXlq.jpg"/>

A lot of these buildings look nice, but when you build thousands of them, they
start to look the same (and bland).
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/NjLsKv5.jpg"/>

Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/l11yYBn.jpg"/>

Despite the abundance of skyscrapers, there are also a lot of wastelands.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/kcF5Yr1.jpg"/>

This is still very much inside the city.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/mCmJiDB.jpg"/>

I don't know any Arabic, but I found it interesting that the spelling of "men"
is so long in this language.

Free hot drinking water is a rare find. Kudos to those who thought about it.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/4Ikmb7B.jpg"/>

Sharps disposal box. I had never seen anything like this before. Is this

This is a sad broadwalk if no pets are allowed. Maybe it's okay if my doggo

<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/5TSzm70.jpg"/>

What I loved about Dubai is how clean it is. The fact that you can go
outside, spend the whole day, and come back home wearing completely clean shoes
is pure bliss. This is something that's practically non-existent in my country.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/yi7t6Vm.jpg"/>

It's not a capitalist country if there's no golf course.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/tUiYBqg.jpg"/>

These houses are also situated on the territory of the same golf course. I guess
you can live and play here.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/VCuo1IC.jpg"/>

In very rare cases, you can see traffic helpers, just like in some Asian
countries.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/gd6lHEf.jpg"/>

In order to lay down a few bricks, you need nine workers. Open question: how
many workers does it take to screw in a light bulb in Dubai?
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/A7bIuvh.jpg"/>

Some of those guys could visit this place and fix it.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/tH8n0Fd.jpg"/>

In very rare cases, manholes can be left open.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/tfx7D3x.jpg"/>

Where the school buses sleep.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/OooNz7K.jpg"/>

Where "environmental-friendly" vehicles sleep. I'm not sure why this parking
space is reserved for them. There's no charging station here.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/af6rnYS.jpg"/>

Where distribution boards (?) are left in the open air. This is not typical of
Dubai.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/pglYRZ3.jpg"/>

The gap between the rich and the poor is very evident in the UAE. I had thought
that everybody in Dubai swims in luxury. It turned out that only some people
really do swim in luxury. They swim their yachts.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/IxX5mba.jpg"/>

The rest swim in their own sweat, induced by the sun.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/cyy1JNq.jpg"/>

Unfortunately, similarly to many Asian megalopolises, you have to use
overpasses. At least in Dubai, all of them have working elevators.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/CvYIscg.jpg"/>

That's because the streets belong to cars.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/OwVG8Ff.jpg"/>

I really love how some malls in Dubai make the directions clear. The malls here
are huge, and it's really easy to get lost.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/lIlYsVI.jpg"/>

Quarantine rules due to COVID-19 are taken seriously here. If you need to wait,
you need to wait.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/FpY7O8E.jpg"/>

That was my Dubai story.
<img src="/assets/images/i.png" data-echo="https://i.imgur.com/YjLtakq.jpg"/>
