During my internship at Bugsnag I took some pictures of the city. My bicycle was
my companion. I cycled through many neighbourhoods of San Francisco and even
managed to cycle to neighbouring towns. The quality of the photos isn't
astonishing. My second companion was my Chinese smartphone. That's why.

The hotel I temporarily settled in was the first hotel I have ever visited.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rFgzF7s.jpg" loading="lazy">

Bathroom.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ZtW0ex.jpg" loading="lazy">

Bugsnag's office was very snug and cosy. In fact, when I showed the photo to my
parents, they confused it with a flat.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lZrmcd9.jpg" loading="lazy">

When I moved from the hotel to a studio apartment, I was lucky to have a
laundromat in my building. It saved me many hours. It is the best invention
of humanity.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NFgufyU.jpg" loading="lazy">

Bugsnag's office is near the UN Plaza. Lots of birds and homeless people nearby.
Once upon a time I stepped on some American chewing gum. It is of very good
quality (curse them).
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OKftU5Z.jpg" loading="lazy">

It is a noisy place, though. The traffic is very dense.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oRyEeb.jpg" loading="lazy">

Although I'd never been to San Francisco before, it felt like I had. Thanks,
GTA!

The IT is real here. Once upon a time I had a project that required integration
with Salesforce. Those were grim days. To my surprise, I found the headquarters
of hell on Earth.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wpPHOGw.jpg" loading="lazy">

Tourists are quite common in this city.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3GlWQkd.jpg" loading="lazy">

It was always hard to keep track of which litter is recyclable and which is not.
SF is obsessed with it. An interesting observation: foundations of urns are
the same, but the top is like a cap and it's possible to replace it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uy92SL9.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hhZYlCR.jpg" loading="lazy">

The public transportation system is incredibly advanced. You can take trams,
trolleybuses, buses, trains and taxis. The buses and the trolleybuses have a rack
in front of them, so you could mount bicycles on them.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qw0bucE.jpg" loading="lazy">

The trams look and in fact are old-school. It's funny, but they're quieter than
our [Tatras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_T3).
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Tf5VRp.jpg" loading="lazy">

The city is perfect for cycling. It has enormous hills to train your legs.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ODYvlSF.jpg" loading="lazy">

Even cars look funny on these hills.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YZBnJUf.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aQNjmUq.jpg" loading="lazy">

It's a bit painful to constantly cycle uphill, but there's always a reward.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/orYbvzA.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hEi7493.jpg" loading="lazy">

And the drivers are very cautious.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/29uYZY6.jpg" loading="lazy">

Well, there are always exceptions.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bhE0TkY.jpg" loading="lazy">

And the infrastructure for cycling is well thought out.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zjOcRnD.jpg" loading="lazy">

And even the government cares about cyclists.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3gC3ku1.jpg" loading="lazy">

There are lots of places you can park your bicycle throughout the city. Even
benches welcome cyclists.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WeD6dcE.jpg" loading="lazy">

Parking of cars is self-regulated.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4giBpYf.jpg" loading="lazy">

There are a lot of parking lots. But they're all empty during the night. I think
cars dislike the moon and they all hide underground. A lot of buildings include
parking lots in their basements. Some buildings are built specifically for
parking.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SUV0y7S.jpg" loading="lazy">

There's a vast variety of lamp posts. Even during the night the city shines.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kqVuYtW.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b2JyHRP.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OtV465R.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4hVWt7Z.jpg" loading="lazy">

The port of San Francisco greets you.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nwN5lq4.jpg" loading="lazy">

I mean, it really greets you.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FP3xMiu.jpg" loading="lazy">

The embankment is quite long.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SZBwceJ.jpg" loading="lazy">

It's called The Embarcadero.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WgXFjwS.jpg" loading="lazy">

The embankment pier has some nice views.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fgzvrI7.jpg" loading="lazy">

From the same spot you can observe a chameleon lighthouse thing.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zq11uoy.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NE1N7NA.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8krLSDZ.jpg" loading="lazy">

The whole embankment is filled with interesting objects. For example, the
traffic lights by this building are synced. It's really hypnotising, when the
colour switches.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hGObN5D.jpg" loading="lazy">

San-Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YHsI0Cr.jpg" loading="lazy">

This is supposed to be scary, but it was almost quiet when I approached it.
There's a deep pool behind this plate.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fL3rbUq.jpg" loading="lazy">

The city is experiencing an IT boom. It's really easy to determine the time now.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wz7vJ8M.jpg" loading="lazy">

A warning from Alcatraz.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1g7qlSt.jpg" loading="lazy">

The trip to the embankment ends here. The boats are sleeping and I decided not
to disturb them.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2tNmfYX.jpg" loading="lazy">

"The roof is on fire" saying is all about San Francisco. I've never seen so many
fire trucks in my life. The city burns every day. It's almost guaranteed that
you will hear the siren of a fire truck at least once a day.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9oTEtD.jpg" loading="lazy">

I have a hunch it's a serious problem. I witnessed the hotel on fire.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yhhXO6Z.jpg" loading="lazy">

Something that no tourist agency will tell you is that there are a lot of
homeless and bonkers people on the streets.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/koM2wba.jpg" loading="lazy">

"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Ha ha, fooled ya, I'm a
submarine".
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qd12PUh.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zgizj59.jpg" loading="lazy">

Speaking of the homeless, it wouldn't be fair if I didn't contrast them with the
rich. From what I read the gap between them is substantial. The contrast can
be observed with the naked eye.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3MwIvdv.jpg" loading="lazy">

There are some rich neighbourhoods like Sea Cliff.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GRFMpzA.jpg" loading="lazy">

There are a lot of posh buildings in this area. A lot of habitants of these
houses see the ocean every day.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xnaOGHG.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SXKShXl.jpg" loading="lazy">

I noticed people prefer not to use curtains.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0koKlP3.jpg" loading="lazy">

Apparently people don't litter in this neighbourhood. It is really clean.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dTn0GMz.jpg" loading="lazy">

Swiss presence.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tdinSsT.jpg" loading="lazy">

China Beach is also in this neighbourhood.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YM5dDFd.jpg" loading="lazy">

From that point you can observe Golden Gate bridge.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/exVCIxl.jpg" loading="lazy">

By the way, beaches are not typical beaches.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OX3rWL6.jpg" loading="lazy">

Don't even try to bring your swimming trunks.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CE2eivi.jpg" loading="lazy">

It's a calm place, though.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gWiBVjv.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WmtrOmN.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SgzXBRy.jpg" loading="lazy">

I don't know much about baseball, but apparently it's a big thing here.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fE1ymG8.jpg" loading="lazy">

People love baseball.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JFb5HCc.jpg" loading="lazy">

There's a big monument on the stadium's roof. The holy bottle of Coca-Cola and
the giant glove catching it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7EkUOI5.jpg" loading="lazy">

Don't like baseball? Play basketball or tennis.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NbHGTnW.jpg" loading="lazy">

Maybe golf?
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7zx3Exi.jpg" loading="lazy">

Oh, are you too short for basketball? No problem, swings are also fun!
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bOklFCu.jpg" loading="lazy">

Stare at the sand beneath the swings if you are not into sports, after all.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f6x4glx.jpg" loading="lazy">

McDonald's is not the solution, don't even try.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YBXeLJO.jpg" loading="lazy">

People seem to be religious here.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vI3tEft.jpg" loading="lazy">

A chapel with a huge bell.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FWlTukk.jpg" loading="lazy">

In general, I saw many churches.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fUiqWT4.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rjMjIZL.jpg" loading="lazy">

Richmond is the neighbourhood where the Gospel House is.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ek5o9Ai.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qmJNlI3.jpg" loading="lazy">

Although it's obvious that Kharkiv and San Francisco are pretty different,
the real difference is revealed to the watchful observer.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y6vtHJ6.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HVFDrlI.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VSZNcTw.jpg" loading="lazy">

Some places reminded me of the Motherland. Every child of Ukraine would
recognise this carousel.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r4scFHc.jpg" loading="lazy">

This building always attracted me for some reason. Its roof suggests to me that
it's some elite mysterious casino. Well, at least that's my perception of it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CSHbYj.jpg" loading="lazy">

Not sure if the pets are always on a leash, but the grass is indeed clean.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MTQfvcM.jpg" loading="lazy">

The Holocaust.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ObvUdlT.jpg" loading="lazy">

I must say, almost all the monuments I've seen are dirty and look unmaintained.
Here's someone's wedding with violins and horses.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rquBQgs.jpg" loading="lazy">

I've never seen anything like this before. Seems redundant.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kb0AW95.jpg" loading="lazy">

Some road signs explain the street's name.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KgXIN0x.jpg" loading="lazy">

Some of them are really verbose.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A3lZy9k.jpg" loading="lazy">

There's a common abbreviation for "crossing" that played a trick on me. It
looks like this --- XING. You can often see this word on asphalt. I was always
wondering, why on Earth, wherever I go I'm in Chinatown.

If you cycle outside of San Francisco, towards Mill Valley, you magically
teleport to the Fallout sceneries.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Io2Apla.jpg" loading="lazy">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UH6ka36.jpg" loading="lazy">

Except there were no helicopters in the game. This one just landed in front of
me, out of nowhere.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ghj39wj.jpg" loading="lazy">

There are many diners and restaurants, but this one is just the best. It has
the fanciest faucet ever.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6QDKzp6.jpg" loading="lazy">

At the same time, it could not afford a normal covering cloth for the table.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YqhelRK.jpg" loading="lazy">

During my stay I was lucky to visit GoGaRuCo 2014. Fun fact: I have applied to
each of the companies you see on this photo and they all rejected or ignored
my application.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yCKXuLU.jpg" loading="lazy">

I've messed up many other good photos that I couldn't include in this report. It
was high time to pack my bags, though.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/btpno9Y.jpg" loading="lazy">

The airport of San Francisco didn't want me to leave.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fo6KNdE.jpg" loading="lazy">

However, the aircraft was ready.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWXYnmP.jpg" loading="lazy">

Kiss it bye-bye.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/z1X2jGW.jpg" loading="lazy">
